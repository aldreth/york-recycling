# York Recycling

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/aldreth/york-recycling.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

Display recycling information for York households, remembering the previously input location.

## Motivation

The [York Refuse/Recycling Collection Lookup website](https://bincollections.azurewebsites.net/) doesn't remember your previously selected location, which annoys me.

Thanks to the city council for leaving the apis open though, so I could use them.
